            All programmers are self-taught to some degree, whether that's fully self-taught or 
            that they have a masters in computer science or information technology, but they taught
            themselves different technologies and tricks along the way. In fact, self-teaching 
            may be one of the most important skills you can have as a programmer.

            It's normal to get very passionate about what we do as developers, I'll admit I 
            was guilty of previously spinning up projects almost every week in the name of 
            practice. While this was admirable, in hindsight, I've come to realize that those 
            projects lacked direction. With real world development, clients and businesses need 
            solutions to a particular problem. Be it helping them to come to the digital age, 
            creating analytics dashboards, building AI systems to ease the business process and 
            a myriad of other reasons. This may seem obvious, but whenever you think of starting 
            a new project, try and think deeply about which problem you're project might solve.

            guaranteed to get you a job.

            <h1>My Tips for New Programmers</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Have your reason, and remember it</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want to start programming, there has to be a reason for that. Whether 
                        its that you love writing code, you want to have a more lucrative career, or 
                        that you are doing a bunch of Excel work and you want to make that more 
                        efficient. Keep track of that reason; programming is hard, and you will get 
                        frustrated sometimes. It will be essential to keep that reason in mind to 
                        stick with it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2. Build a solid foundation</h3>
                    <p>
                        This may be a unique piece of advice, but I think its really helpful. 
                        Before you start writing code, if you haven't looked at math in a while, 
                        I would revisit the concepts from Algebra 1. Most of programming is built 
                        on algebra 1 math -- i.e., functions and variables. Understanding these 
                        concepts outside of programming will be super valuable in the future.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>3. Break down problems into smaller ones</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most important parts of programming is taking a large problem 
                        and breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces until those pieces are 
                        solvable. If you are looking at a blank text editor not knowing where to 
                        start, it may be because you haven't broken down the problem enough!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Pseudocode</h3>
                    <p>
                        A lot of times it is beneficial to write down in detail what you are trying to do in 
                        plain words before even trying to write code. This process is called pseudocoding, and 
                        it can take whatever form you want it to. It can also be helpful to solve a problem 
                        really slowly on paper first, thinking about or even writing down the individual steps 
                        you are taking to solve that problem.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>5. Embrace the cycle of learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you're learning to code as a second career, especially if you've been away from the 
                        classroom for a while, learning how to learn is going to be a big part of your process. 
                        There are lots of ups and downs involved, which is very natural! I would brace yourself 
                        for that rollercoaster before starting out.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>6. Start with free resources</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are a million and one resources for learning how to code. Some are free, and 
                        some are paid. I would start with the free resources, make sure you like writing code, 
                        and then after that, you could think about moving onto paid resources or even a bootcamp. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>7. Find your niche</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of worlds within programming, find one world that you love 
                        and focus on that. Instead of trying to learn 8 programming languages, 
                        frontend and backend, compiled and interpreted languages, all the text 
                        editors and developer tools, etc. Find a few things you are really 
                        interested in and get good at them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>8. Get good at pattern recognition</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recognizing patterns in code is one of the most important skills you can have.
                        When people talk about writing "DRY" code they are talking about reducing the 
                        patterns in your code.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>9. Make good habits early</h3>
                    <p>
                        It will be easier to write clean code in the future if you get into the habit
                        early. Bad habits can be hard to break. If you are doing web development, 
                        running HTML and CSS validators on your code can tell you exactly what to 
                        fix!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>10. Identify your learning style</h3>
                    <p>
                        Everybody learns differently, whether that means you are a visual learner, 
                        love videos, need somebody to push you, or you love documentation, you will 
                        learn best differently than the person next to you. Identify how you learn 
                        best, and rely on resources that fit that style well. For example, I learn 
                        best from reading documentation and code examples from that documentation, 
                        and I lose focus easily in tutorials.

                    <h3>11. Struggle, but not too much</h3>
                    <p>
                        Struggling a little bit when you are learning is really important so that 
                        you can solve the problem yourself and find an answer using resources that 
                        exist. That being said, it can become unproductive and demotivating to 
                        struggle with a problem for too long. After a few hours, reach out to 
                        someone for help!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>12. Get comfortable with failure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Programming is hard, and finding the right answer won't be immediate. 
                        It can be challenging to adjust to not getting everything right away 
                        and seeing those error messages, but that is a huge part of programming.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>13. You don't need to know everything</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is straight up 100% impossible to know everything about programming. 
                        Nobody knows every programming language, every single method that's out 
                        there, every library and framework, or the perfect solution to every 
                        problem. Don't worry about learning everything, just focus on what 
                        you do know and extending that.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>14. Focus on the fundamentals first</h3>
                    <p>
                        The fundamentals of programming are invaluable, and you will use 
                        them no matter what you end up doing with programming. Focus on having 
                        a solid knowledge of loops, conditionals, functions, data types, and 
                        (in most languages) object-oriented programming before moving on to 
                        learning about that awesome library that everyone's talking about. 
                        It will be so much easier to learn that library once you know the 
                        fundamentals really well. They will also carry over from language 
                        to language, so you only have to really learn them once after that 
                        it's just syntax!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>15. Get good at researching</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the biggest things to learn is how to find good answers to your 
                        questions or to learn new features of your language or library. Using 
                        Google is important, so is joining communities and subscribing to resources. 
                        The Google template I normally use is "problem language/framework/library" 
                        in as few words as possible and without filler. So, "sort array JavaScript", 
                        "spin element CSS", or "create router Vue."
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>16. Build projects you love</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you're learning, you will be building various projects to practice 
                        (and show off) your skills. Pick project ideas that are interesting to you;
                        you will be much more likely to finish them and want to put work into them.
                        Related, complete those projects. A few really good finished projects is way
                        more impressive than a bunch of half-finished ones!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>17. Compare yourself to only yourself</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are a lot of people learning to code out there. Don't compare your 
                        progress to someone else's, instead compare yourself to previous you and 
                        focus on your own growth.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>18. Celebrate your wins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Learning to program can be a really difficult process, so when you accomplish
                        something, even if its small, celebrate it!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>19. Celebrate your wins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Programming is really cool because you get to build things.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>20. Keep going!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Believe in yourself and one day you'll reap the reward.
                    </p>
